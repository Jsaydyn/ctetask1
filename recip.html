    <h1>Strawberry and Mint Muffins</h1>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<p>

2 cups flour    <br>
3/4 cup sugar    <br>
3/4 teaspoon baking powder    <br>
1/2 teaspoon salt    <br>
2 eggs    <br>
3/4 cup milk (180ml)    <br>
2/3 cup vegetable oil (160ml)    <br>
1 cup strawberries, hulled and chopped - From the Garden if in season    <br>
3 tablespoons fresh mint, chopped - From the Garden if in season    <br>
</p>
<h2>Method:</h2>

    <p>
1. Preheat oven to 200C<br>
2. Grease and flour medium muffin cups or line with paper patty tin cups.<br>
3. Add sifted flour, sugar, baking powder and salt to a large bowl and make a well in the centre.<br>
4. Make an egg mixture by combining egg, oil and milk in a bowl or jug. Mix until combined.<br>
5. Add the egg mixture to the well in the dry ingredients and stir until mixed. Do not over-mix or dough will be heavy. Stir in strawberries and mint.<br>
6. Pour into muffin cups and bake for 20 to 25 minutes until done. (Hint- Do not turn your oven up to speed up the cooking process - this will make your muffins brown on the outside and uncooked in the middle!)<br>
